The AI engineer successfully progressed the SU√âLTALO crypto wallet application through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on resolving a persistent black screen rendering bug on the Dashboard, which involved implementing specific user-guided UI fixes like , , and a re-engineered header. Key technical challenges included addressing  incompatibility with React Native Web and correctly configuring  for nested routes and ErrorBoundaries. Following this, the development shifted to creating a comprehensive onboarding flow, which included a , , segmented  screens (, , ), and a  Call-to-Action screen. All these new screens adhere to the Urban LATAM design language. The codebase was then reorganized using 's route groups ( and ) for better modularity. The  was refactored to conditionally redirect users based on wallet presence detected via . The current impasse is a Cargando... state, attributed to  being incompatible with the web build environment, preventing the initial wallet check from completing.

The user requested a non-custodial crypto wallet app, SU√âLTALO, for Solana Devnet. Core features include user onboarding (create/import with seed phrase), sending/receiving USDC (with QR), transaction history, a basic rewards system (SLT token airdrops, mock on Devnet), and mock KYC integration. The UI/UX evolved into an Urban LATAM identity featuring a carbon black background, neon accents (electric blue, magenta, green), gradient headers, bold typography, rounded 2xl buttons, neon glow cards, and friendly urban Spanish microcopy. The Dashboard specifically requires neon cards for USDC, SLT, and SOL balances, three large gradient action buttons (Enviar, Recibir, Rewards), and a bottom navigation bar. Subsequent requests included a Welcome screen with AMYGROUP LLC logo, a SU√âLTALO neon gradient title, a tagline (Tu wallet. Tus reglas. Sin bancos. Sin drama.), an info box, and an Aceptar button to navigate to Tour screens. Segmented Onboarding Tour screens were added for Migrantes (‚úàÔ∏è icon, Env√≠a feria a tu familia al toque), PyMEs (üè™ icon, Cobra en d√≥lares digitales), and Freelancers (üíª icon, Recibe tu paga global sin esperar), each with specific content, neon buttons, and navigation dots. A final Call-to-Action screen was requested with neon green glow, Tu Wallet. Tus Reglas. Sin Bancos. Sin Drama. title, Crear mi wallet üöÄ (electric blue), Ya tengo una (gray), and S√°ltatelo por ahora options. The routing logic requires  to redirect to a splash screen if no wallet exists, or to the home dashboard if a wallet is present.

- **Solana Blockchain:** Integration via  for Devnet wallet operations, balance queries, and transaction handling.
- **Non-Custodial Wallet:** Seed phrase generation and secure storage using  and .
- **Expo/React Native:** Mobile-first development,  for file-based routing and route groups,  for UI effects.
- **FastAPI/MongoDB:** Backend services providing API endpoints and data persistence.
- **Polyfills:** Essential for / compatibility in React Native environments.
- **React Native Styling:** , platform-specific shadow properties for UI consistency.

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI, MongoDB) and  (Expo React Native).



-   : This file is the primary entry point for routing logic. It was initially updated to handle redirects based on wallet presence using , then simplified for efficiency. Its current state causes a Cargando... loop in web builds due to  incompatibility.
-   : This defines the root navigation structure using 's Stack navigator. It was created and updated to include , configure header visibility, and integrate the  for robust UI.
-   : A newly created React component used to gracefully handle rendering errors across the application, displaying a user-friendly message and logging details.
-   : A new onboarding screen introduced as the first point of contact for new users, featuring animations and branding.
-   : This screen provides an introduction to SU√âLTALO, styled with Urban LATAM aesthetics and guiding users to the tour screens. It was updated for sequential navigation.
-   , , : These three files represent segmented onboarding tour screens. Each provides specific value propositions for different user groups (Migrants, SMEs, Freelancers), featuring custom icons, gradients, and microcopy, with sequential navigation.
-   : This screen serves as the final call-to-action in the onboarding flow. It was implemented to handle wallet creation (using  and ) or initiation of an import flow, and provides options to skip onboarding.
-   : Formerly , this is the main dashboard screen. It was extensively modified to fix rendering issues, display real Devnet balances (SOL, USDC, SLT), implement pull-to-refresh functionality, and show a CTA if no wallet is present, replacing earlier debug blocks.
-   , , , , , : These core wallet functionality screens were moved from the root  directory into the  route group for better organization and maintainability.
-   : Contains the logic for generating new wallets () and managing existing wallet data, utilized by the  screen.
-   : Was previously modified to resolve crypto/dependency issues; its configuration is critical but protected.
-   : Contains environment variables for Solana RPC, USDC/SLT mints, and app name.
-   : Continuously updated to document testing outcomes and agent communications.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of QR code generation for sending/receiving.
- Complete implementation of the Rewards system beyond basic airdrops.
- Full implementation of the KYC flow beyond mock endpoints.
- Development of the Ya tengo una (import wallet) flow from .
- Address compatibility issues with  in web builds.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on ensuring the comprehensive routing and wallet presence check was fully functional, particularly in web builds. The  file was updated to perform an asynchronous check using . This logic determines if a user has an existing wallet: if  is found, the user is redirected to ; otherwise, they are redirected to . The  screen was also updated to integrate  for creating a new wallet and storing its details in  before redirecting to the home dashboard.

The application is currently experiencing a critical bug where it gets stuck on a Cargando... screen in the web build. Debugging efforts (console logs) revealed a  error. This explicitly indicates that  is not compatible with or correctly implemented for the web build environment, preventing the initial wallet check in  from completing and leading to the infinite loading state.
