The AI engineer successfully initiated the SUÉLTALO non-custodial crypto wallet project, moving from initial setup to a functional MVP, then progressively enhancing its UI and microcopy based on user feedback. Key early challenges involved configuring the Solana Web3.js library for a React Native/Expo environment, particularly around polyfills and resolving crypto dependency conflicts, which required significant debugging in  and . Once foundational stability was achieved, the focus shifted to implementing a mobile-first dark urban UI, later refined to an Urban LATAM aesthetic with neon accents and gradients. The latest iteration involved updating all microcopy to a friendly, urban Spanish tone and a significant redesign of the Dashboard. The current state is paused due to a critical UI rendering bug (black screen) encountered after the latest Dashboard update, which the AI is currently investigating through logs.

The user requested a non-custodial crypto wallet app SUÉLTALO for Solana Devnet. Key features include: user onboarding (create/import with seed phrase), send/receive USDC with QR code, transaction history, a basic rewards system with an internal SLT token (airdropped per transaction, mock on Devnet), mock KYC integration (, ), and a mobile-first dark urban UI. The app connects to , uses USDC mint , and a temporary Devnet SLT mint (exposed as ). Subsequent requests refined the UI to an URBAN LATAM identity (carbon black background, electric blue/neon magenta/green accents, gradient headers, bold typography, rounded 2xl buttons, neon glow cards, subtle animations, digital graffiti QR, confetti/badges for rewards, gamified KYC). Finally, all UI text was updated to friendly urban LATAM microcopy in Spanish, followed by a specific Dashboard redesign with neon cards for USDC, SLT, SOL balances, three large gradient action buttons (Enviar, Recibir, Rewards), and a bottom navigation bar.

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI, MongoDB) and  (Expo React Native).



-   : Created to include necessary polyfills (, , ) for Solana Web3.js compatibility.
-   : Created as the main entry point, importing  before 's entry. 's  field was updated to point to this.
-   : Modified multiple times to resolve crypto/dependency issues, specifically by adding  configuration to handle  and  modules correctly, and adjusting .
-   : Scaffolded with , , , .
-   : Updated to include Solana-related dependencies (, , , , , , , ), and modified  entry.
-   , , , , , , , , , : These files were created and iteratively updated to implement the core UI, apply the Urban LATAM design, and integrate the friendly Spanish microcopy.  imports were corrected across these files.
-   : Created to handle wallet generation and import logic, initially struggling with crypto dependencies but later refined.
-   : Contains FastAPI endpoints for health checks, wallet operations, balance queries, transactions, rewards, and KYC mock system.

The most recent changes involve extensive modifications to  to implement the neon card layout and gradient buttons, which led to the current rendering issue.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of QR code generation (currently a text placeholder).
- Complete implementation of the Rewards system beyond basic airdrops.
- Full implementation of the KYC flow beyond mock endpoints.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a significant design update for the Dashboard screen. This included displaying USDC, SLT, and SOL balances within neon glowing cards, adding three large rounded buttons with neon gradients for Enviar (Send), Recibir (Receive), and Rewards, and incorporating a bottom navigation bar with neon icons for Inicio (Home), Historial (History), and Configuración (Settings). This work was applied to . After restarting the Expo service to reflect these changes, the user reported a critical rendering issue where the app preview showed no se ve bien en la app preview, solo una pantalla negra y la mitad de color sin nada (a black screen with partial color and nothing else). The AI is currently at the stage of diagnosing this bug by checking the application logs.
